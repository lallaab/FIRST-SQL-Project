# FIRST-SQL-Project
hey, this is my first SQL project.
for this project i used SQL Server to explore the dataset and here are some of the insights:
- the booking cancellations are significantly higher for the city hotel than they are for the resort hotel
- note that the dataset has limitations like the fact that for the year 2018 the first 6 months are missing and for the year 2020, the last 4 months are, but nonetheless i noticed that for the years 2018 and 2019, october and sptember are the most popular months at both hotels whereas for the year 2020 it was may and june for the city hotel and august and may for the resort hotel.
- day 28 is the most popular day throughout the year for both hotels except for the city hotel, year 2018 it was day 5
- the 2 most popular countries of each year for the city hotel are Portugal and France, and as for the resort hotel it's Portugal and Great Britain
- the reservation status percentage of each year is just another way to notice how high cancellations have been each year
- ...
- the thing that caught my attention the most is the significantly high number of mismatches between the reserved room type and the assigned room type.
